It also highlights a few points that may need further clarification during your implementation.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n1. OVERVIEW & OBJECTIVES\n\n\u2022 Aim to implement the Transformer architecture from scratch without relying on any official code.\n\u2022 Reproduce major experiments:\n\u2003 \u2013 Machine Translation on WMT 2014 English\u2192German and English\u2192French.\n\u2003 \u2013 English Constituency Parsing on the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank.\n\u2022 Verify model quality using BLEU scores for translation and F1 for parsing.\n\u2022 Use the same architectural design, training schedule, learning rate scheduling, and regularization techniques as described in the paper.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n2. MODEL METHODOLOGY\n\nA. Architecture Components\n\n\u20031. Encoder Stack:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Consists of N = 6 identical layers (for the base model).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Each layer contains:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 A multi-head self-attention sub-layer.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 A position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Each sub-layer has a residual connection followed by layer normalization.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 All sub-layer outputs and embeddings have dimension d_model = 512 (for the base model).\n\n\u20032. Decoder Stack:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Also consists of N = 6 identical layers.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Each layer contains three sub-layers:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003a. Masked multi-head self-attention (to prevent positions from \u201ccheating\u201d by looking ahead).\n\u2003\u2003\u2003b. Multi-head attention over the encoder\u2019s output (encoder-decoder attention).\n\u2003\u2003\u2003c. Position-wise feed-forward network.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Residual connections and layer normalization are applied around each sub-layer.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The input embeddings in the decoder are also offset by one.\n\nB. Attention Mechanism\n\n\u20031. Scaled Dot-Product Attention:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Compute dot products between queries and keys.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Scale by dividing by \u221a(d_k) where typically d_k = d_model/h (e.g., for h = 8, d_k = 64).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Apply softmax to get weights and then use them to compute a weighted sum of values.\n\n\u20032. Multi-Head Attention:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Perform h = 8 parallel attention operations.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For each head, apply learned linear projections for queries, keys, and values.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Concatenate the outputs from each head and project with a final linear layer.\n\nC. Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\n\u2003\u2013 Consist of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\u2003\u2013 Input/output dimension is d_model (512 for the base), and the inner-layer dimension is d_ff = 2048.\n\u2003\u2013 These are applied identically and separately at each position.\n\nD. Embeddings, Positional Encoding, and Softmax\n\n\u2003\u2013 Use learned embeddings to map input tokens; output tokens are also embedded.\n\u2003\u2013 The same weight matrix is shared between the embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation.\n\u2003\u2013 Multiply embedding weights by \u221a(d_model) before summing with positional encodings.\n\u2003\u2013 Positional Encoding:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Use fixed sinusoidal positional encodings defined as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003- PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / (10000^(2i/d_model)))\n\u2003\u2003\u2003- PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / (10000^(2i/d_model)))\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 These encodings supply order information without recurrence.\n\u2003\u2013 Note: The authors also experimented with learned positional embeddings, which produced nearly identical results.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n3. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\nA. Datasets & Tokenization\n\n\u20031. Machine Translation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 WMT 2014 English-to-German:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Use approximately 4.5 million sentence pairs.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Tokenize using byte-pair encoding (BPE) with a shared source-target vocabulary of ~37,000 tokens.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 WMT 2014 English-to-French:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Use approximately 36 million sentence pairs.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Tokenize sentences into a word-piece vocabulary of 32,000 tokens.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Batching:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Batch sentences by approximate sequence length.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Ensure that each training batch contains roughly 25,000 tokens for the source and 25,000 tokens for the target.\n\n\u20032. English Constituency Parsing:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Use the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) subset of the Penn Treebank.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 \u201cWSJ-only\u201d setting: Approximately 40K training sentences with a vocabulary of 16K tokens.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Semi-supervised setting: Use additional corpora (~17M sentences) and a vocabulary of 32K tokens.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Modify beam search settings (see below) to accommodate long output sequences.\n\nB. Training Schedule & Hardware\n\n\u20031. Hardware:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Use a machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Base model training on the translation tasks: 100,000 steps (about 12 hours total).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Big model training: 300,000 steps, which takes approximately 3.5 days on 8 GPUs.\n\n\u20032. Optimizer & Learning Rate:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Use the Adam optimizer with:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 \u03b21 = 0.9,\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 \u03b22 = 0.98,\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 \u03f5 = 10\u207b\u2079.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Learning rate schedule:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Increase the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps (= 4000 steps).\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 After the warmup phase, decay the learning rate proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This dynamic schedule is crucial for stable and effective training across steps.\n\n\u20033. Regularization:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Apply dropout in several places:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Residual dropout: Dropout is applied to the output of each sub-layer before adding the residual.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Dropout is also applied to the sums of the token embeddings and positional encodings.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For the base model, use a dropout rate P_drop = 0.1.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Note: For the Transformer (big) model, particularly on the English-to-French task, a dropout rate of 0.1 is used even though some experiments tested other values (e.g., 0.3).\n\n\u20034. Label Smoothing:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Use label smoothing with a smoothing factor \u03f5_ls = 0.1 during training.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This regularizes the model predictions, trading off perplexity for improved BLEU scores.\n\nC. Checkpointing & Inference Details\n\n\u20031. Checkpoint Averaging:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For the base translation models, average the last 5 checkpoints (saved at 10-minute intervals).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For the big models, average the last 20 checkpoints.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This averaging step is important for reducing model variance at inference time.\n\n\u20032. Inference (Beam Search):\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Use beam search with:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Beam size = 4 for translation tasks.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Length penalty \u03b1 = 0.6 is applied.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Set the maximum output length to \u201cinput length + 50\u201d for translation.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For constituency parsing, modify beam search:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Use beam size = 21.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Use length penalty \u03b1 = 0.3.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Increase maximum output length to \u201cinput length + 300\u201d to accommodate longer sequences.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n4.

Optionally, run a short validation pass on val_data every few thousand steps (or according to design decisions) to monitor overfitting.\n\n\u2022 Edge-case: If training is resumed from a checkpoint, load the last step counter and optimizer state from Trainer.load_checkpoint() so that the learning rate schedule continues correctly and training time is properly accounted for.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n5. Checkpointing (save_checkpoint and load_checkpoint)\n\n\u2022 save_checkpoint(path: str):\n\u2003\u2013 Gather all critical state information, such as model.state_dict(), optimizer.state_dict(), and the current self.step_num.\n\u2003\u2013 Save the gathered states to the specified file path using torch.save.\n\u2003\u2013 This saved checkpoint will later be used for either training resumption or for checkpoint averaging (i.e., averaging the last 5 checkpoints for the base model as described in the paper).\n\n\u2022 load_checkpoint(path: str):\n\u2003\u2013 Load the state from the file (using torch.load).\n\u2003\u2013 Restore model state, optimizer state, and update self.step_num accordingly.\n\u2003\u2013 This function will allow continuation of training from a previously saved checkpoint.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n6. Logging and Metrics\n\n\u2022 Throughout training, log key metrics:\n\u2003\u2013 Loss score (and smoothed perplexity if needed).\n\u2003\u2013 Current training step and learning rate.\n\u2003\u2013 Elapsed time per batch or overall training time.\n\u2003\u2013 Checkpoint saving events.\n\u2022 Use the tqdm package (as specified in the required packages) to wrap the training loop for a dynamic progress bar.\n\u2022 All logged outputs should reference the configuration values where applicable (for example, printing the learning rate calculated using d_model and warmup_steps from config).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n7. Integration with Other Modules\n\n\u2022 The Trainer relies on:\n\u2003\u2013 The Model class (from model.py) to perform the forward pass.\n\u2003\u2013 The dataset provided by DatasetLoader via train_data (which will yield torch.Tensor objects as defined by the design).\n\u2022 It must work seamlessly with these modules by strictly following the provided interfaces (e.g., calling model.forward(batch_input, mask) and using DatasetLoader\u2019s load_data() output).\n\u2022 The Trainer class does not implement any additional public member functions not specified in the design; it only implements __init__, train, save_checkpoint, and load_checkpoint.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nSummary\n\nThe Trainer class in trainer.py will:\n\n1. Initialize with the model, data, and configuration.\n2. Create the Adam optimizer with the hyperparameters (\u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b5) from config.\n3. Implement a custom learning rate scheduler based on the provided formula and update the optimizer\u2019s learning rate every training step.\n4. Run a training loop that:\n\u2003\u2013 Loads batches, performs forward passes, computes loss with label smoothing, backpropagates gradients, updates the model, and logs metrics.\n\u2003\u2013 Saves checkpoints periodically, with the interval defined in config, thereby enabling later checkpoint averaging.\n5. Provide functionality to load checkpoints for resuming training.\n6. Log all training details for further evaluation and debugging.\n\nThis logic analysis ensures that the code written in trainer.py will precisely follow the experimental design laid out in the paper and the specified configuration settings while staying aligned with the overall project design."}]
